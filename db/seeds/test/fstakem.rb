                                Welcome to my home here on the web. As an engineer I naturally like to build things.
                                If you do too we may get along. I tend to think most people would like to, but the devil is often in the details.
                                I went to engineering school at Purdue and Georgia Tech but have tried to live by the words of Mark Twain,
                                "Don't let schooling interfere with your education." Day after day I continue to learn and build new things even though time seems to be in short supply these days.
                                Maybe my next project will be more than a prototype.

                                I suppose listing my work on this site is a bit meta. 
                                I used to have a wordpress site that contained all of my work but I changed that out
                                for my own custom built rails site you see here. Unfortunately I don't have a good
                                reason to explain my switch. As a software developer I just felt if I am going to
                                have a website that I might as well just build it myself. In my career I have also 
                                flipped back and forth between using rails and Python for web development. 
                                After starting this project off in Django I switch to rails as still think it 
                                is the most complete framework out there. No thanks node.js. On this site I spent a lot of time 
                                making my web resume look like my latex one and I think it turned out well. Think
                                of this site as my ongoing research platform for putting new ideas and technologies up.

                                This research is just starting to get under way. I have a strong background in 
                                signal processing that I gained in grad school at Tech. My goal was to implement 
                                a platform for audio signal capture so I could work on interesting data analysis
                                problems. Working with stock data does really interest me as not having control 
                                of the data collection is a huge hinderance to doing really interesting things. 
                                So far the hardware portion of this has been quite a bear so we will have to see 
                                how far this goes.

                                For a while now I have been interesting in gaining more information on working 
                                software systems. This information could be useful for bug detection, security, 
                                or more for use in more advanced formal methods. A while back I wrote some 
                                code to parse logs of many different system. One of the hardest parts of this 
                                problem is how to deal with the unstructured portion of portions of a log. 
                                For the mean time I have put this project on the back burner but would like 
                                to pick it back up again.

                                In grad school I had two specializations. The first was networking and the second 
                                signal processing. Networking was my stronger focus at first but working in the DSP 
                                group I was determined to make algorithms that could be game changing. 
                                I spent many years collecting data, running the data through simulations, 
                                and doing analysis of my algorithms. The recent development of data sceince as a highly 
                                desired profession sparked my interest in refreshing my data skills. In addition 
                                to reading books, I have taken a decent amount of online classes and short courses. 
                                Working at Medlytix I was able to do a lot of work on data processing pipelines for batch processes.
                                Maybe all of this will lead to something great, but for the time being I plan on trying
                                to keep my algorithm skills up to date.

                                When I first started working in the the signal processing lab my professor was interested 
                                in the streaming of 3D meshes since that was what his PhD was on. The first task I was instructed 
                                to do was to network together a very rough virtual environment prototype. 
                                This project led to me researching the networking done in gaming and virtual environments. 
                                Most of the previous research on the topic was done on a technique called dead reckoning. 
                                I spent many years researching this and experimenting with algorithms for the transmitter 
                                and the receiver to lessen the effects of the network on the end user experience. 
                                My research was more specifically done on human hand movement which is different than avatar 
                                movement in a typical first person shooter. I collected data, wrote algorithms and simulations, and eventually a few research papers. 
                                I always thought this problem was a hard one as the current techniques are good but more 
                                advanced techniques are very difficult. My only consolidation to this was in the passing on of 
                                my 100 page proposal to a friend working on the networking at the gaming startup Artillery.
